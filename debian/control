Description: XRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions.
 XRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular
 expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support
 natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping
 and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky
 inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex`
 property.
 .
 XRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB
 when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+,
 Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.
